Wedding Website: first run
===================
2014

This is the code from the failed first run of my wedding website.

Most of the code is pretty functional, there are some bugs. Social pressure, more than the limits of browsers and my abilities, forced the doors to close on this one. There is another repo, wedding-website, that has the (very different and less ambitious) finished product.

The dream of HTML5 video backgrounds will have to wait...

Thanks,

Pat
